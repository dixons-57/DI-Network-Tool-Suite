# DI Network Tool Suite
 A tool for examining and decomposing delay-insensitive networks of modules based on process calculi specifications. Created in support of PhD thesis.

It requires the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to be installed on your system. It has been tested extensively in multiple versions of
Microsoft Windows, but should also run on any Unix-like system provided the JRE is installed. To run, launch the command "java Launch" 
from inside the main directory (the directory containing Launch.class). To launch on Windows, you may simply double click the included 
Run.bat

Helpful instructions on how to enter definitions are found within the program itself, by clicking on the various "?" buttons on each tab.
The program also includes examples of modules and networks from throughout the thesis.

For more details on the technical aspects of the software, and the underlying theoretical principles, please consult the doctoral thesis titled:
